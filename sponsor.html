			<h3>What kind of exposure will our API get?</h3>
			<p>Prior to the event, each API will be listed on the main event page with a link to the API and a listing of the prize(s) offered to attendees for using the API at the event.  Additionally, each company will get a 5-10 minute speaking spot Saturday morning to pitch their API.</p>
			
			<h3>Does somebody from our API need to be at the event?</h3>
			<p>Each API should have a representative at the event Saturday morning to give a talk on the API and also Sunday afternoon to watch the team presentations to decide which team wins their prize.</p>
