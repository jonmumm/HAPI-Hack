			<p>HAPI Hack Weekend is looking for API companies interested in sponsoring the June 10-12 event in San Francisco.  If your company is in interested, contact Jon at <a href="mailto:mumm@tokbox.com">mumm@tokox.com</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Is there a cost to sponsor the event?</h3>
			<p>Sponsoring the event is free, however we ask that any API that participates offer a prize to the team that best uses their API.</p>
			
			<h3>What kind of exposure will our API get?</h3>
			<p>Prior to the event, each API will be listed on the main event page with a link to the API and a listing of the prize(s) offered to attendees for using the API at the event.  Additionally, each API will get a 5-10 minute speaking spot Friday night and the opportunity to run a 30 minute workshop on Saturday.</p>
			
			<h3>Does somebody from our API need to be at the event?</h3>
			<p>Each API should have a representative at the event Friday night to give a talk on the API and also Sunday afternoon to watch the team presentations to decide which team wins their prize.  Optionally, they can have somebody present on Saturday to give a workshop on getting started with the API.</p>
